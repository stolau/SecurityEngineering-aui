# Tasks

### Task 1: Choose A ***or*** B

#### Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security

Online Banking is of the most lucrative targets for phishing and scams. How do our browsers protect us against them?

Look at the following snippets from a browsers address bar:

![Bank image 1](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week2_Banking_and_Payments/Images/bank_1.png)

![Bank image 2](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week2_Banking_and_Payments/Images/bank_2.png)

![Bank image 3](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week2_Banking_and_Payments/Images/bank_3.png)

**Questions:**

- What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?
    It means that the site is not using HTTPS connection and is using HTTP connection instead. On going traffic is not secured by standard encryption and
    things such as passwords can be leaked if someone is capturing traffic

- Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?
    This site is using private connection. Meaning anything you get or send from the site is private. 
- What other ways are there to detect a phishing/scam site? 
    Usually URLs are sketchy. Containing special letters, which redirects to different address.
    - Are there any tools available online?
        There are multiple tools able to trackdown phising sites.
        Most of these tools do analyze visited site from any kind of common phising attempt.
- What is typosquatting and how does it relate to the pictures?
    Typosquatting is social engineering attack which uses link to seemingly common site, but includes typo in URL.

    - What is **UDRP** and how does it help with combatting typosquatting?
        Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy
        Sites following the policy are able to make complaint about potentially confusing or similiar url.
        If complaint succeeds, the site will be taken down
    - If you were to own the domain **ouspg.org** and would be running your crypto banking application at **bank.ouspg.org**, what domains could you monitor for warning signs of possible phishing attempts against your customers?
        -Any top level domains such as .com and .net.
        -any sites which can be confused to original site.
        -Sites which do not have interests for specific name
        -Domain names that are used in bad faith.
        

#### Task 1B: Certificates

You have probably seen the following kind of warning when browsing the internet:

![Certificate image 1](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week2_Banking_and_Payments/Images/certificate_1.png)

**Questions:**

- What are digital certificates used for?
    To provide user information if site is using cryptography and Public key infrastrucute and authenticity of the server.
    - Why are certificates important for online payments and banking security?
        -It provides safety for clients and the service.
    - What other uses do certificates have?
        -In emails and hardware
- What kind of attacks does TLS mitigate and why is this important for online banking?
    -Communication security over computer network.  
    -It does not allow connected third party systems to interfere.
- How do browsers use certificates for ensuring browsing security?
    They are inspecting if site has correct/required certificates and informs user if there is something suspicious going on.
    - What does the warning in the picture above mean?
        It means that site you are about to enter does not have certificates required by browser and continuing to the site could be dangerous.

**Certificate Authorities**

Read the following entries on Certificate Authorities and Certificate Transparency and answer questions:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency
https://certificate.transparency.dev/howctworks/
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pubbydate/html/index.en.html

**Questions:**

- Why would it be bad if a trusted certificate authority was compromised?
    If CA is compromised. Security to enterie system is lost.
- Why is certificate transparency important?
    Binds public cryptographic key to a domain name.

### Task 2: Cards and Payments

**Read the following:**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication

**Questions: Payments**

- Why do modern payment cards use a chip and not a magnetic stripe?
    Magnetic stripe can be manipulated. Magnetic stips stores static account information. While never EMV cards do not,
    this gives another level of security. 
- What are EMV Certificates and why are they relevant for payment protection?
    EMV Certificate authority gives digital certificate to payment card.
    Public key certificate and SSAD
    This process allows issuer to verify that card is actually legit.
- What attacks exist against payment cards?
    - Card-not-present?
        Online payment fraud
        Credit card information stealing, js sniffing attacks
    - Contactless payment?
        Devices such as flipper zero can be easily modified to send and receive data from contactless payment cards.
        Securing your cards specific card cases can be used to block unwanted signals.

**Questions: MFA**

- How is multi-factor authentication (MFA) used in banking?
    Banks do use multi-factor authentication to verify legimacy of the user.
    Physical code tables are exists and banks have mostly moved to digital verification. Including SMS and apllications
- How does multi-factor authentication increase payment security?
    If credit card information is stolen. It does not automatically mean that card can be used in order to purchase anything. Since user
    still have posession of authenticaton devices.
- What MFA methods are you using in you daily life?
    -Fingerprint on phone and phone applications.
    -Location on google accounts
    -Posession on most of the accounts used.
    -Knowledge. Every account is protected by unique passwords.
- What attacks exists against different forms of 2FA?
    - Time-based-one-time-password?
        Bypassing active session.
        Social engineering. Tricking user to provide one time password
    - Text Message?

## Task 4: Subdomain Takeover ***or*** Non-Technical Alternative

### Task 4: Subdomain Takeover

Practising use of browser developer tools and Python by playing out an example scenario of subdomain takeover on a simple Banking application.

## Pretask

Summarize in a few sentences what is a subdomain takeover?

- https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/10-Test_for_Subdomain_Takeover
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subdomain_takeovers

```


```

## Requirements

This task requires `docker`.

## Summary

You have been tasked to test a new banking application developed by an intern at OUSPG which is riddled with bugs and flaws
in software design. In this exercise we will mainly look over the most obvious flaws in the application and focus on
subdomain takeover.

During development the application was created with a microservice architecture in mind and was originally deployed to
an application platform hosted by a hosting provider. However, later in development the service was moved to run on its
own servers and most of the microservice components were retired.

In this task you will get to familiarize yourself on how a subdomain takeover could happen and what effects it could
have. You will get to inspect a very simple web application and figure out how it works. You will also need to write
your own simple web server to receive data.

Completing this exercise will help you familiarize yourself with your browsers developer tools and Python programming.

## Task

To get started run `docker compose up` and follow the next few steps:

1. Open your browser to http://bank.ouspg.org.localhost:8080/
    - You should now see a screen with option `login` and `register`
    - Register a user to the site (for example `a` and `a`)
2. You should now be in the home screen again with a view of your balance and an option to send money.
3. Now logout from the application.

As this is all running locally, the subdomain takeover is not done by inspecting DNS, but rather analyzing faults within
the website itself.

#### Subdomain Takeover

Open up the [home page](http://bank.ouspg.org.localhost:8080/) again and the developer tools of your browser
(alt + f12).

__Task 1:__ Find out what the application does when you log in

- What methods get called and where?
    - _See the network tab of your browser's developer tools as well as the console_
- What data gets saved?
    - _See the storage tab of your browser's developer tools_
- Is any data sent to external services?
    - _You can inspect the request headers and body via developer tools_
- Is there anything hazardous about the login process?

```


```

__Task 2:__ Figure out which subdomain of the application is vulnerable to takeover

- How did you figure out the domain?
- How can you find out the hosting provider after finding out the domain?

```


```

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

Try and see if any response in the network tab differs from the others.
Then try and navigate to that address while keeping an eye on your developer tools.
Inspect any responses you receive while investigating the domains.

</details>

__Task 3:__ Taking over the domain

Now that you found the target domain and the hosting provider, make an assumption that the subdomain was running in the
app engine of the provider. We will be simulating a small cloud provider which handles their ipv4 allocation by simply
provisioning them via roundrobin for any servers joining their app platform.

- Visit the imaginary cloud provider management portal at http://hosting-provider.org.localhost:8080/servers/docs
- Try out the functionality of the API portal and try to get the IP of the target subdomain under your control
    - You can see this by monitoring the target subdomain for a change in response

In this case the IP range is very small, and you can perform this task manually. However, in any real scenario the pool
of ip addresses would be big enough to warrant automation. Create a script to automatically provision servers until you
get the desired domain by utilizing the underlying API of the management portal:

```


```

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

You can look at the _Network_ tab of you browsers developer tools while using the management page.
See any requests and their content when you click buttons on the page.
You can also use the inspect feature on most browsers and look into the page source.

For the script, you can use the `requests` library in python:

```python
import requests as r

r.post('http://my-server/my-path', json={
    'data': 'value'
})
```

</details>

__Task 4:__ Hijacking data

Your task is to create an application that collects users that log in to the application and hijacks their session if
they navigate to your subdomain page.

If you have trouble receiving the login callback data from the banking application, familiarize yourself with
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and make required adjustments.

Test your application by creating another user in the banking application and by navigating to your site.
You should be able to transfer all their money to your account.
You should also be able to receive callbacks from the banking application when users log in.

Place your code in the [create_your_server.py](create_your_server.py) file.

<details>
    <summary>Hints</summary>

Try and inspect the banking application and see what data it sends during login.
Also, inspect what data you possibly want to get from users when they land on your page.

You can take inspiration from [analytics.py](analytics.py)

You can use the provided script and add endpoints as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response, Cookie
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class MyAPIModel(BaseModel):
    value: str


@app.options('/')
def my_function(request: Request, response: Response):
    ...


@app.get('/')
def my_function(cookie_value: Cookie(alias='my-cookie')):
    return {
        'my-data': 'is-json'
    }


@app.post('/')
def my_function(model: MyAPIModel):
    ...

```

You can see the intro for [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) for more guidance.

</details>

To finish off run `docker compose down -v` to delete any residual volumes.

__Task 5:__ Questions

- Now you were able to take over the user session. Imagine a situation where you would only get the
  callback when they log in. Why would even this information be useful for attackers?

```


```

- How can subdomain takeovers be prevented?

```


```

- What additional protections could an organization do to prevent abuse even if a subdomain takeover occurs?

```


```

## Additional Questions

Normally you could do subdomain recon via DNS queries to find domains that exist, but do not lead anywhere.

- Does the tool `nmap` have any useful scripts or plugins to find out (un)used subdomains for a site?
- What kind of arguments would you use to find subdomains for `example.com`?
- Are there any other tools or services to find out subdomains for a server?

```


```

Additionally, some good resources for domain discovery are __Passive DNS__  and __Certificate Transparency Logs__.
Research online what are they and how could you utilize them for subdomain takeover and summarize it in a few sentences:

```


```

A way to find out the hosting provider for a site is by seeing if it has a `PTR` record automatically configured by the
hosting provider in DNS.

What is a `PTR` Record?

```


```

Only looking at DNS data, can you tell who hosts the domain `ouspg.org`

```


```

(Optional) Take a look at the code for the [banking application](bank.py) and find out at least three major points where the
development has gone terribly wrong. Summarize in a few sentences to what type of attacks could the application be
vulnerable to or what major security flaws it has:

```


```
