# Tasks

### Task 1: Lock-ins

Idea behind technological lock-in is that more users use the technology more unlikely user will switch to another technology. This is not only for electronic devices, but same principles work for other consumables. One of the side effects of technological lock-ins are that users are more likely to use some outdated technology because of habit, instead of moving to more advanced solution. This might cause technology to change more incrementally than radically. Also negative side effect is that when multiple similiar technological solutions start to compete, usually the one which is first adopted will take control over market.
Vendor lock-in is quite similiar as technological lock-in. However supply of this item comes from only one vendor, instead of relying on certain type of technology. 
For example buying iphone with unique charger. If you want to buy new charger or headphones, you are vendor locked to Apple products. However if you would buy Android phone, you would be technologically locked to usb-c charger and bluetooth headphones, but still would have able to buy devices from multiple vendors.

### Task2: Security Psychology

Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends!
using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:
- why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
    -Phishing attacks ofter rely on a heat of the moment. Making targets to think too fast and panic, which leads to poor choice.
    Timing of phishing attack can be used against target aswell. If attack is timed early in morning or just before work shift ends. It can be much more impactful than randomly timed attack. Multiple targets can be attacked at the same time and even if total number of victims are low, it can still lead to succesful attack.
- why social engineering works on people?
    -Reasoning is somewhat same as in phishing attack. However social engineering is more targeted practice. People in overall are willing to bend rules and policies for their own convince or just simply trust too much on provided authority instead of checking it out.
- why many people have hard time using  passwords in secure way?
    Using passwords properly takes time and effort. Having unique password on all your devices can be painful without any tools to maintain them. This can cause people simply ignoring security of password and end up using same password for years in multiple devices.
- why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?
    -Moslty because PGP is old.Its been widely used for years and there have been numerous unfixed vulnerabilities and it was last patched over 5 years ago. When its not completly useless, there is a list of better standards to encrypt your messages. 
- why it is so easy to spread malware?
    -Malwares can be hidden to basically any file. People do trust websites too much and might download perfectly good looking program from wrong site, which includes hidden malware which then spreads to the device. Earlier this year common Minecraft addon provider had all of their addons infected by malware. Since addons can be easily updated, every single downloaded addon started spreading the malware over the night and thousands of blindly trusting users were victoms.

## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights

Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each.

Intellectual Property is used when property is not physical. For example insight of companys future plans or unpublished features. It is highly valued asset inside the company to keep the edge against competitors. Copyright policy is used to notify users how certain program or technology is meant to be used. There can be restrictions to use for example editing given source code or using given source code for commercial usage. Policy essentially claims that specific files are lawfully owned by company and therefore breaking the copyright can cause legal troubles. Patents are claimed for inventing new technology and is then legally owned by the company. Patents can be sold to competitors and if someone decides to use patented technology it must be compensated to patent holder. NDAs are the way to get agremeent between two parties not to speak about things they have witnessed during certain visit or meeting. They do protect company's IP from being leaked by third parties or company employees.

Watermarks are more used on papers and art, which can be harder to duplicate. Software licences are usually part of some software, which customer is supposed to pay to unlock. Software can be free, but additions to software can be under licence. Once is aqcuired it usually provides new TOS and unlocks features under the license. DRM some employees might not be able to see more than just intended part of software. This method is used to prevent massive data leaks, but can complicate working with partners since they might not have same access and vice versa. Dongles are usb devices, once they are plugged in to your computer they provide license. This method is nice way to avoid unnecessary internet connection and compromising device. Dongles usually require some kind of mainting from both customer and provider, which causes complications and are being used more rarely and only if absolutely necessary.

### Task3B: Freedom of Information

Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.


There have been multiple ways to bypass software licences over history. Some licenses are not limited to 1 install, can cause multiple people to use same license even when against TOS. Using licenced software can also be bypassed by having "laboratory" computer which has access to the software with the license. Sharing the license still exists today and it is one way to avoid extra prices from multiple license keys. There is multiple ways to avoid this kind of behaviour.
